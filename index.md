[NOAA Climate Data](/sample_page)
<p>
  <strong>Project overview:</strong>
  In this project, I used NOAA climate data to analyze temperature trends across various global weather stations and developed a database to support interactive data visualizations. Using Python, SQL, and Plotly Express, I structured the data and crafted a database that enables users to query specific temperature records by country, date range, and month.

</p>
<p>
  After organizing the data, I wrote a query function to retrieve temperature data and a function to estimate yearly temperature increases at different stations. This function calculates linear temperature trends using linear regression on historical temperature data, producing a geographic scatter plot with points representing weather stations. The color intensity of each point reflects the estimated yearly increase in temperature at each station, creating a visual summary of warming trends over the specified period.

</p>

<p>
  The final output is an interactive map that allows users to observe temperature changes across various regions, effectively highlighting the impact of climate change through localized temperature trends.
